	<description>Simple module to grab weather from many cities around the globe, via MSN Weather. To get the code for your city go to http://weather.msn.com/. Per example, looking for Porto from Portugal it gives this results http://weather.msn.com/search.aspx?weasearchstr=porto. Now when you mouse over the links see that in some of them you have this codes wc:[CODE] like http://weather.msn.com/local.aspx?wealocations=wc:POXX0022 http://weather.msn.com/local.aspx?wealocations=wc:41677 http://weather.msn.com/local.aspx?wealocations=wc:SPXX0176. This codes after 'wc:' are the ones you can use, but you need to pay attention that only the ones that have the first two letters representing the country before double XX and a number are the valid ones. 41677 is not valid but POXX0022 and SPXX0176 are valid. Since i wanted Porto from Portugal(PO) and not from Spain(SP) it was used the POXX0022 as city code. If you don't like the name of the town that comes by default from MSNBC Weather just add '=TownNameYouLike' after city code (eg. 'POXX0036=Evora,POXX0074,POXX0066').
